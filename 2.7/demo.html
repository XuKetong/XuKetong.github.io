            <h1>Automatic disinfection trash can </h1>
            <p>In response to COVID-19,
                this automatic disinfection trash can was designed for the recycling of people's masks.                
            </p>
            <p>
                A disinfectant water storage tank is added to the original foot-operated trash can. 
                Using the knowledge of mechanical structure, 
                a device is set up to automatically spray disinfectant water when people throw garbage.
            </p>
            <p>
                It not only avoids the problem of people touching the trash can with hands, but also effectively kills bacteria and viruses. 
The cost is controllable and the operability is strong.
