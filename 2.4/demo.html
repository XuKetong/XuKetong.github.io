            <h1>楚唱风生 | Bluetooth audio design based on Chu opera culture  </h1>
            <p>Chu Opera is one of China's intangible cultural heritage. At present, the audience of Chu Opera is generally aging, and the proportion of young people who love Chu Opera is very low. To make Chu opera culture attract more young people, it is necessary to give Chu opera culture a new look, so that more audiences can be familiar with and accept it.</p>
            <P> This design takes Chu Opera as the cultural background, audio equipment as the carrier, and Chu Opera "The Story of the White Fan" as the prototype. Combined with the opera fragments of the mother and son in the play, the characters, costumes, props and other cultural elements of the mother and son in the play are extracted for design.</P>
            <P> By integrating the characters in Chu opera into the audio equipment, the culture of Chu opera is reproduced. </P>

            <h2>Color ＆ Material</h2>
            <P>Taking the characters in the play as a reference, determine the main color direction : purple and blue. 
                Combined with traditional Chinese colors, the set of color matching was finally determined.

            <p>The materials are mainly wooden shells and knitted fabrics.</br>
                The wooden speaker has the characteristics of elegance and warmth, which basically matches the elegant characteristics that this design product wants to show.Knitted fabric sound-transmitting fabric, this material echoes the wooden shell, not only has a certain decorative and good functionality, but also better highlights the elegant features of the product.Metal alloys mainly play a decorative role in details, which can form a contrast between materials and make the product more refined. </p>
